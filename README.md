## Week 1 — Python Basics

In Week 1, I focused on building the Python foundation required for NLP and Machine Learning.

### Topics Covered
- **Variables & Data Types**  
  Learned different data types in Python and how variables are used to store data.

- **Getting Input from Users**  
  Learned how to take input from users to make programs interactive.

- **Python Syntax**  
  Understood basic Python syntax and program structure.

- **Lists, Tuples, Sets**  
  Learned how lists, tuples, and sets work and their differences in flexibility and usage.

- **Type Casting**  
  Learned how to convert one data type into another.

- **Strings**  
  Worked with string slicing, modifying strings, format strings, escaping characters, and string methods like `capitalize()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `index()` etc.

- **Operators**  
  Learned different types of operators used in Python.

- **Conditional Statements**  
  Used `if`, `else`, and `elif` to control program flow.

- **Dictionaries**  
  Learned dictionary syntax, storing data as key-value pairs, and operations like adding, changing, and removing elements.

- **Loops**  
  Practiced `while` loops and `for` loops, and understood the `range()` function. Compared Python loops with C++ loops.

- **Comments**  
  Learned how to write comments for code readability.

- **Functions**  
  Learned functions, default parameters, arguments, nested functions, recursion, and decorators.

- **Ex**
